Everyone wants to feel confident. But they also want to avert disaster. We can help.

Sometimes you have a strategy or tactic that's difficult to test in advance. You need a second set of eyes, from outside your organization, to advise your team.

When it comes to loyalty or incentives, we will give you confidence in your strategic decisions. We will apply our broad and deep experience, our access to proven behavioral science, and our extensive technical skills to your ideas. 

* Is your plan supported by behavioral science?
* Does your plan have a precedent with a similar audience?
* Is there any sound science that supports or contraindicates your approach?
* What's the worst that could happen?
* What's the best?

Our strategic designers, analysts, and consultants will give you confidence to execute your plans.
