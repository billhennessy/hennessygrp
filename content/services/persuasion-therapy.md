Persuasion is not about manipulation or tricking people into doing what *you*. It's helping them get what *they* want, in the context of your business. 

For example, we help job seekers complete the application process on behalf of staffing firms. The job seekers need and want meaningful work with commenserate pay. The staffing firm wants to fill a requisition. The employer wants to get work done. Using persuasive design techniques and the best-fit technology, we help the job seeker overcome the barriers. 

Our analyses uncover hidden opportunities to improve your customer journey at every point. Because we have access to the powerful tools of persuasive design, our solutions might look a little different from your competitorsâ€”but our results are better.
