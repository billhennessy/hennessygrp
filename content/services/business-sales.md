Here's what's included the Persuasive Mindset Lab

## Build Internal Advocates

Five years after their first lab, a customer planned a second. Someone suggested saving money on the next lab by reducing the participant count from 25, which is standard, to just five or six. The executive sponsor shot that down quickly:

"Are you kidding? The first lab saved us a fortune in time and money because it produced 25 internal advocates from every department. Without all those people being involved, we would have needed a six-month change management campaign just to get our own people onboard. If anything, we should *add* people to the lab."

When your team leaves the lab to execute the new approach, they will leave with a strong sense of ownership. And a thorough understanding of the *intent*. You won't need to engage your change management consultantsâ€”you'll have your own. And nothing sells like entusiasm.
